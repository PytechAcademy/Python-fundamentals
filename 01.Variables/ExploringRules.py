#Creating a variable 'name'
name = "John"
print(name)
# Try out the below cases, it ends up in error and understand do's and dont's
# ❌ print(Name) - variables are case sensitive
# ❌ 1name = "John" and print(1name) - variables can not start with numerals but they can start with _,small or caps letters
# ❌ if = 'John' and print(if) - variables cannot start with keywords or reserved words. Others include - for, while etc
# ✅ name_1 = "John" and print(name_1) - variable name can be alphanumeric
# Note : Python allows to write multiple variables in one line
a,b,c = 10,12,13
print(a) # output would be 1ß
