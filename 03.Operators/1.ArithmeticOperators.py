# Arithmetic operators
a = 11 # Assigning a number to the variable
b = 2
Sum = a + b # Addition
Product = a * b # Multiplication
Difference = a - b # Subtraction
Division = a / b # Exact Division
Quotient = a//b # Floor Division
Remainder = a % b # Modulo (remainder after division)
Exponent = a**b # Exponent
print("Sum:", Sum) # Output: Sum: 13
print("Product:", Product) # Output: Product: 22
print("Difference:", Difference) # Output: Difference: 9
print("Divison value:", Division) # Output: Division value: 5.5
print("Quotient:", Quotient) # Output: Quotient: 5
print("Remainder:", Remainder) # Output: Remainder: 1
print("Exponent:", Exponent) # Output: Exponent: 121

# Increment and decrement
x = 5
x += 1  # Increment by 1
print("Incremented x:", x)  # Output: Incremented x: 6
x -= 2  # Decrement by 2
print("Decremented x:", x)  # Output: Decremented x: 4
