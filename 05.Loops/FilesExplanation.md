| 1. WhileLoop.py          | Demonstrates the `while` loop for repetitive execution based on a condition. |
| 2. ForLoop.py            | Illustrates the `for` loop for iterating over sequences and performing actions on elements. |
| 3. LoopwithDecisionMaking.py | Shows loops combined with decision-making statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) for conditional processing. |
| 4. BreakStatement.py     | Demonstrates the `break` statement to terminate loops prematurely based on specific conditions. |
| 5. ContinueStatement.py  | Illustrates the `continue` statement for skipping iterations in loops based on certain conditions. |
